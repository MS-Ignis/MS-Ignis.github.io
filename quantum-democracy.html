                TL;DR: Ideal Citizen = Quantum Particle
            </p>
            <p>
                Digging through the deep trenches of science and logic, humanity has often been led to truths which if digested through powerful enough thought yield deeper insights into the various branches of philosophy. We often see the semblances of Einstein’s great discoveries in the writings of Milton and to find the essence of Confucius’ thoughts in Newton’s Principia Mathematica.

                Quantum mechanics is perhaps the most mind boggling sphere in all of physics(if not in all of science itself). Its theories though a major part of pop science flummox not only laymen but also accomplished scientists belonging to other domains. One of its most seminal insights is that of the theory of superposition. It is often found manifested as Erwin Schrödinger’s famous thought experiment ‘Schrodinger’s Cat’.

                The experiment seeks to explain how a particle can exist in multiple states at a given instant of time. Imagine that you place a cat in an opaque box with a piece of deadly radioactive material inside it and shut the box. If the material has equal probability of decaying into its lethal products every minute, after exactly one minute the cat has an equal probability of being both dead and alive. In other words from your perspective this feline quantum particle is both alive and dead at the same time. If that wasn’t uncanny enough, opening the lid at this instant would directly influence the fabric of reality itself. Observation changes reality. By removing the lid and looking at the cat you have observed it and caused it to be alive or dead. Think of this as the cat snapping to an alive or dead state from its semi-alive state of superposition because you observed it. This might be a lot to wrap your head around but the basic understanding is this:
Particles can exist in multiple states at the same time and observing them causes them to assume a particular state for cosmic convenience. (Superposition is shy I guess)

                What does all this quantum voodoo have to do with democracy? Well, think of yourself, the ideal citizen as a single quantum particle(or a cat in an opaque box with a deadly radioactive material which is surprisingly metaphorical). Now, you should behave exactly as our imaginary cat. You should be in superposition with respect to ideologies even through the constant bombardment of opinionated ideas meant to influence you. Having an equal probability of leaning either way on an issue gives you, the ideal citizen,  the freedom of allowing the merits of an argument to influence you as the forces of nature influence a quantum particle. Just as the quantum particle snaps to a particular state on observation, the ideal citizen picks their side only on the day of voting. It is the day the State asks you a question about your state vis-à-vis which side having considered all the merits and demerits do you see fit to hold office. Only on one day does the ideal citizen truly have a physically expressible opinion. Every other day of their existence they can be, in their swirling deluge of thoughts, both socialist and capitalist, red and blue, right and left, authoritarian and libertarian, globalist and nationalist, and everything and nothing all at once. As the Booker Prize winning author Kiran Desai brilliantly writes of humans, “Every single contradiction history or opportunity might make available to them, every contradiction they were heir to, they desire. But only as much, of course, as they desire purity and a lack of contradictions.”
